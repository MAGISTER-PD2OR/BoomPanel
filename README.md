# BoomPanel<sup>Î²</sup> <br /> *The* admin panel for sourcemod based servers

## Overview
This admin panel is in the works for quite a while and is currently in **beta**. Is is useable nevertheless, but the project is unfinished and bugs to be expected.
*This software currently only supports CS:GO, due to it's beta stage. Other games will be included.*

### About
The main purpose of the admin panel is to provide the necessary features to control your game server, without the need of creating beeing precent ingame or opening an RCON gateway.

Features include:
* mobile access
* friendly web interface
* balists
* mute/gag
* admin activity
* *and much more...*

Not every feature is yet ready for release and has probably some bugs. Please help us find them or maybe even make some friendly suggestions in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6x3xBjx).

### How can I help?

Other ways that are super helpful are: **pull requests** and **issues** on the GitHub.
